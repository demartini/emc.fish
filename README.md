## Customization

### Using custom command

If you would like to customize `emc` default command, then set your own `EMC_CMD` universal variable. For example:

```fish
set --universal --export EMC_CMD ec
```

Alternatively, you can add the following line to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
set --export EMC_CMD ec
```

### Using different editor

The default editor is [VS Code][], but if you would like to use a different one, then set your own `EMC_EDITOR` universal variable. For example:

```fish
set --universal --export EMC_EDITOR nvim
```

Alternatively, you can add the following line to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
set --export EMC_EDITOR nvim
```

### Using custom config files 
Using the `add` option, you can add your own config files to `emc`. For example:

```fish
❯ emc add foo .config/bar
Adding 'foo','.config/bar' to ~/.config/fish/conf.d/emc_options.txt
```
The add command assumes the file is in your home directory, so you don't need to add the full path.

If you are uncertain about everything you have added, you can list all options with the `list` option. For example:

```fish
❯ emc list
Option: bash
Config location: ~/.bashrc

Option: fish
Config location: ~/.config/fish/config.fish
[...]
Option: foo
Config location: ~/.config/bar
```


The option can be removed with the `remove` option. For example:

```fish
❯ emc remove foo
Adding 'foo','.config/bar' to ~/.config/fish/conf.d/emc_options.txt
```
